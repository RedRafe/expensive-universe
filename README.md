# Expensive Universe

---

Expensive mode for Krastorio2 and Space Exploration.

## Features

- Supports any combination of the two mods: K2, SE and K2+SE

- Makes intermediate products more expensive like vanilla Factorio's expensive mode, while other recipes remain pretty much unchanged (won't break any production line)

- Expensive recipes only require "more" of the original ingredients, no new ingredients are added to the recipes

- It is possible to add/remove **Expensive Universe** mod to/from ongoing saves

- Expected resource complexity is ~2x, just like vanilla expensive mode
